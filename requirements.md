Requirements & Strict Rules:

1. Technologies & Versions:
   - **Build Framework:** Use React.js (latest version) via Create React App (or a similar setup).
   - **Pre-Installation:** Automatically install all necessary React.js tools and dependencies before starting the coding process. This includes:
      - react-router-dom (for routing)
      - TailwindCSS (latest version) for styling
      - Framer Motion (for animations)
      - Any additional packages required for SEO and responsiveness.
   - Ensure that the package.json reflects all dependencies and that the build process includes an automatic installation step.

2. Sequential Task Completion:
   - **Task 1:** Set up the React.js project structure and install all required dependencies.
   - **Task 2:** Build and test individual UI components with proper naming conventions (e.g., /components/HeroSection.js, /components/FeaturesGrid.js, /components/PricingTable.js, /components/Testimonials.js, /components/Footer.js).
   - **Task 3:** Integrate design inspirations from Total Drive and RoboSoul, ensuring the design is unique to DrivEdify.
   - **Task 4:** Develop the landing page sections (Hero, Features, Pricing, Testimonials, FAQ, and Footer) with conversion-focused CTAs.
   - **Task 5:** Include a clear "Coming Soon" message and a sign-up form for the waiting list.
   - **Task 6:** Optimize for responsiveness across mobile, tablet, desktop, and laptop devices.
   - **Task 7:** Implement SEO best practices with proper meta tags, structured data, and Open Graph tags.
   - **Task 8:** Deploy the landing page on Netlify with GitHub integration, including a Netlify.toml configuration if needed.

3. Design & UI/UX Guidelines:
   - Follow a modern, minimalist design inspired by successful SaaS websites (e.g., Stripe, Calendly, Notion, Intercom).
   - Use proven fonts such as Inter, Montserrat, or Roboto.
   - Maintain strict design consistency: uniform color palette, spacing, and component styling.
   - Include high-contrast, sticky CTAs like “Start Free Trial” and “Upgrade to Premium,” even though the app is coming soon.
   - Use Framer Motion for subtle animations to enhance interactivity.

4. Feature Integration:
   - **Hero Section:** Display a compelling headline and subheadline emphasizing DrivEdify's unique value and that the app is "coming soon." Include the DrivEdify logo prominently.
   - **Features Grid:** Highlight key benefits such as Student Progress Tracking, Lesson Scheduling & Booking, AI-Powered Lesson Insights, Mock Driving Tests & Assessments, Hazard Perception Training, and In-App Payments & Invoicing.
   - **Pricing Section:** Clearly present a pricing comparison showing the Free Plan versus the Premium Plan (£10/month), along with tiered discounts, one-time purchase options, and a 30-day free trial.
   - **Testimonials:** Display real instructor reviews in a carousel or grid layout.
   - **FAQ Section:** Provide useful information (e.g., What is DrivEdify?, How much does it cost?, Can I cancel my subscription?, etc.).
   - **Waiting List Sign-Up:** Incorporate a prominent sign-up form for users to join the waiting list, with clear instructions and a thank-you message upon submission.

5. Branding & Messaging:
   - The official name of the web app is DrivEdify. Ensure this name appears throughout the landing page and in the logo.
   - Emphasize that the app is "coming soon" to build anticipation.
   - Use a professional color scheme (e.g., blue, white, gray tones) to evoke trust and modernity.

6. Deployment:
   - Deploy the landing page using **Netlify**.  
   - Include a Netlify.toml configuration file if required.
   - Ensure smooth GitHub integration for automatic deployments.
