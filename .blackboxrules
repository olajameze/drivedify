You are tasked with developing **DrivEdify**, a premium web app for driving instructors. This app is inspired by **TotalDrive** (https://totaldrive.co.uk/) but aims to provide enhanced and unique features. The app must strictly follow modern development practices and be fully functional before moving to the next feature.

## **Strict Development Requirements**  
1. **Focus on One Feature at a Time** – Each feature must be fully completed, tested, and error-free before moving to the next.  
2. **Follow Modern Development Practices** – Use **React.js with Next.js**, **TypeScript**, **Tailwind CSS**, and other best tools for efficiency.  
3. **Ensure Full Page Linking** – Every feature should be correctly linked, allowing smooth navigation.  
4. **Fix All Errors Before Proceeding** – The app should be bug-free at every stage.  
5. **Incorporate Additional Inspirations** – Use **TotalDrive**, **RoboSoul**, and other industry insights to improve features.
